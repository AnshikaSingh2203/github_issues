# github_issues

 <!-- In this project, our task is to raise an issue in github_issues repo,
 Create a branch on that repo 
 Add input code, output code and metadata.json files into that branch after fixing a code with nugs with a model's response
 and then create a Pull Request(PR). -->

# So the problem statement for the problem Balanced Parentheses which contains a bug and need to be fixed is:

<!-- Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'. -->


# The code which contains a bug is entered into the input_code.py file.

# The code that contains the model response(that is, the code after fixing the bugs) is in output_code.py file.

# A metadata.json file is provided to get an idea of the task performed and to analyze the model's performance.
